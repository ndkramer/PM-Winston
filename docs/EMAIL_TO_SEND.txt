Subject: Request: Setup Webhook Integration for Our Miro Board

Hi [Board Owner Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I've built an automated system that will capture and store all activity from our Miro board for analysis and record-keeping. To make this work, I need your help setting up a webhook connection (don't worry - I'll walk you through every step!).

WHAT IS A WEBHOOK?
A webhook is like a notification system - whenever someone adds, updates, or deletes something on our Miro board, Miro will automatically send that information to our application. This helps us track changes, collaborate better, and keep a history of our board activities.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: Access the Miro Developer Portal
1. Go to: https://developers.miro.com/
2. Click "Sign in" (top right)
3. Sign in with your regular Miro account

Step 2: Create a Miro App (if needed)
1. Click "My Apps" in the top menu
2. If you already have an app, skip to Step 3
3. Click "Create new app"
4. Name it: "PM-Winston Integration" (or any name)
5. Click "Create app"

Step 3: Configure the Webhook
1. In your app dashboard, click "Webhooks" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Add webhook" or "Create webhook"
3. Fill in the form with these EXACT details:

   WEBHOOK URL (copy exactly):
   https://pm-winston-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/miro

   BOARD SELECTION:
   - Select "Specific board"
   - Board ID: uXjVJWWN1_Y=
   - Or use board URL: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJWWN1_Y=/

   EVENTS TO SUBSCRIBE (check all these boxes):
   ✓ item:created
   ✓ item:updated
   ✓ item:deleted
   ✓ board:updated

   STATUS:
   - Set to "Active" or "Enabled"

4. Click "Save" or "Create webhook"

Step 4: Test It
1. Open our board: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJWWN1_Y=/
2. Add a sticky note with "Testing webhook"
3. Let me know - I'll verify it worked!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Double-check the webhook URL is exact (copy/paste from above)
- Make sure the correct board is selected
- Ensure webhook status is "Active"
- If stuck, send me a screenshot and I'll help!

SECURITY:
- Connection is encrypted (HTTPS)
- Only our specific board is tracked
- Data stored securely in our private database
- No additional personal info collected

Need help? Just reply to this email or let me know if you'd like to hop on a quick call to set this up together!

Thank you so much for your help with this!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
